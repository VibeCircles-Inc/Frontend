# VibeCircles Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup and fixes performed on the VibeCircles social networking platform codebase.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Asset Path Inconsistencies ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Inconsistent asset paths across HTML files (some using `../assets`, others using `../../assets`)
**Solution**: 
- Created and ran a Python script to systematically fix all asset paths
- Root level files now use `./assets`
- Subdirectory files use appropriate relative paths (`../assets` or `../../assets`)
- Fixed paths in 30+ HTML files

### 2. Database Configuration Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Hardcoded database credentials and poor error handling
**Solution**:
- Updated `php/config/db.php` to use environment variables
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Created centralized configuration system in `config.php`
- Added fallback values for development environments

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: File upload security issues and missing validation
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `php/api/upload_media.php` with:
  - MIME type validation using `finfo`
  - File extension validation
  - Secure filename generation
  - Directory creation with proper permissions
  - Better error handling and logging
  - Support for WebP images
- Added CSRF protection functions
- Implemented input sanitization helpers

### 4. Missing Security Headers ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: No security headers or server configuration
**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive `.htaccess` file with:
  - Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
  - Content Security Policy
  - File access restrictions
  - Compression and caching rules
  - Custom error pages

### 5. Configuration Management ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Scattered configuration settings
**Solution**:
- Created centralized `config.php` with:
  - Environment-based configuration
  - Database settings
  - Security settings
  - File upload limits
  - Helper functions for common operations
  - Session management
  - Error reporting configuration

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
- `config.php` - Centralized configuration
- `.htaccess` - Apache server configuration
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Files Modified:
- `php/config/db.php` - Enhanced database configuration
- `php/api/upload_media.php` - Improved security and validation
- All HTML files (30+) - Fixed asset paths

## Security Improvements

- Add database migration system

### 2. Asset Optimization
- Implement image optimization and compression
- Consider using a CDN for static assets
- Add lazy loading for images
- Implement responsive images

### 3. Security Enhancements
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Add two-factor authentication
- Implement proper password hashing (if not already done)
- Add API authentication tokens

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Add logging for performance metrics
- Implement error tracking
- Add monitoring for file uploads and database queries

### 5. Development Workflow
- Add automated testing
- Implement code linting
- Add deployment scripts
- Create development environment setup
